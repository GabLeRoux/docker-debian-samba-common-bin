# docker-debian-samba-common-bin

A very simple docker image that contains the [`samba-common-bin` package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/samba-common-bin) to get hands on `smbpasswd` command.

This was created to solve [smbpasswd command not found on MacOS High Sierra](https://superuser.com/posts/1333537/).
